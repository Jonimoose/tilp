	    see its interest.
	    * removed - [BoxesController msgBoxOrUser2DidEnd] -- all we
	    needed to do is to wait until the user stops the modal by clicking
	    on the button, this is handled by Cocoa, so it was useless.

	    tired to finish it.
* 20011029 : v0.1.1

	* Train trip again...
	     * Re-enabled sheets : found that I don't have to use
	     [NSApp runModalForWindow] all the time. Great.
* 20011201 : v0.2.1
	* Got screendump to work this evening
	* The refresh button now points to - [MenuController getScreen]
* 20011202 : v0.2.1
	* Did a bit of optimization when rendering the screen, using memset()

	* Fixed proposed filenames and extensions in the various
	NSOpenPanels/NSSavePanels

	* Merged in TiLP 4.82
* 20020112 : v0.3.2
	* libticables/libticalcs fixes.
* 20020113 : v0.3.3
	* Fixed version in window title, about box.
	* Fixed typos in GUI.
	* When a folder is selected, transfer all the vars in the folder.

	* Fixed sendFlashApp.
* 20020115 : v0.3.5
	* Fixed screen dump corruption in img_cnv.c.
	* Display free mem (wrong atm, waiting for new libticalcs).
	* Added TransfersController class.
	* Threaded FLASH APPS upload.
* 20020115 : v0.3.6
	* All important transfers threaded (except dirlist).
	      => working "Abort" buttons.
	* Fixed Windows menu handling, wrt pbar sheets.
* 20020116 : v0.3.7
	* Do not use - [NSString getCString:buffer] when handling paths,
	use - [NSString fileSystemRepresentation] instead.
	* Do not malloc() then - [NSString getCString:buffer], it's better
	to strdup(- [NSString cString]).
	* Try to get all windows or sheets open by the same thread. We use
	NSNotification to achieve that, did a test with pbarType1. Not
	really what I expected...
* 20020117 : v0.3.8
	* Implementing Remote Control
	     => Added RCTextView, subclassing NSTextView
	     => Modified the Remote Control window to use
	     a scrolled NSTextView

	* More *boring* remote control stuff.
	     => TI92 keyboard.
* 20020120 : v0.3.9
	* Overriding -insertText: was _not_ a good idea.
	* Overriding -keyDown: is a far better one :)
	* So we have a mostly working remote control.

	* Fixed the Information box.
* 20020121 : v0.4.0

	* Fixups regarding 4.85 messup with libticalcs 3.0.7.
* 20020125 : v0.4.1
	* Change my mind again wrt Remote control
	    => new implementation using a subclass of NSImageView
	    and the skins from GtkTiEmu. The keyboards are not yet
	    usable, but the Remote control works as it did previously
	    using the RCTextField.
* 20020126 : v0.4.2
	* Added 89y to the list of known vars for the TI-89 (reported
	by: Benjamin Esham).

	    => Wiped out some methods
	    => Wiped out some windows
	    => Cleaned up some of the classes
	* Fixed prefsClose: wrt calc type
	    => Call rc_save_user_prefs() after ticalc_set_calc(),
	    as the former uses ticalc_get_calc() which will return
	    the right calc type only after the latter is called
* 20020126 : v0.4.3

	* Fixed TI-89 modes handling in remote control.
* 20020128 : v0.4.4

	     [both reported by Matthew Bryant]
* 20020207 : v0.4.5
	* Greek letters in remote control.
	* Pop up a sheet when calc is ready.
	* Reset pbars texts and values when "destroyed".
	* Catch "Clear" key on the Mac keyboard.
	* Keypad Enter is not Return !
* 20020208 : v0.4.5
	* Fixed the glib build, so that g_warning and friends are
	no longer functions defined in glib.h but macros. Cleaner build.
	* Threaded vars upload.
