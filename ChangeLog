	* while in the train to home (8 hours) :
	    * implemented pbars refresh system
	    * small ameliorations in the previous cocoa code
	    * renamed cocoa_msg_sheets.[ch] to cocoa_sheets.[ch]
	    * modified the pbar*_window to contain determinate progress
	    indicators
	    * implemented save screendump
	    * fixed - [BoxesController screendumpRefresh] to behave like
	    the GTK version
	    * removed the "Load" button from the screendump window. I can't
	    see its interest.
	    * removed - [BoxesController msgBoxOrUser2DidEnd] -- all we
	    needed to do is to wait until the user stops the modal by clicking
	    on the button, this is handled by Cocoa, so it was useless.

	    tired to finish it.

	pointers to nil, as TilpController is the last to be sent
	awakeFromNib...

	not sheets)
