Previous version: 6.78b		(29/04/2005)
Current version:  6.80		(19/08/2005)
Add-on version:   6.80b		(01/01/2005)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.

Note: direct USB cable of TI84+ / TI89 Titanium is currenly unusable by TiLP 
		  but supported by our driver.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- PDF/EPS image support (w/ compression) for screenshots 
		(Julien Blache's contribution)
		
	- the installer can download & install the GTK+ libraries
	- the installer copies the LPG's SilverLink driver. No need to download it for now.


Improvements:
-------------

	- [Linux] can be compiled with gcc 4.0 for now.
	- [Win32] the installer now copies the SilverLink driver files, 
							don't need to download them !
	- virtual link cable support


Bug fixes:
----------

	- various bug in the cable management layer
	- possible buffer overflow with recv_packet (usually occurs with 
				virtual links because the received length is invalid).
	- fixed detection of TI file signature (not case sensitive)
	- make loading of FLASH OS more robust against file 'garbaged' by TI.


Known problems:
---------------

	- [Win32]: the GTK-Wimp theme displays a lot of warning under non-NT Windows. 
		You can disable it by using the GTK theme selector.
	- [Linux]: don't user kernel module for SilverLink, use built-in ticables support instead.


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
