			[ Release notes ]



Current version:  0.20-beta (05/08/2006)
Current version:  0.23-beta (27/08/2006)


SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- full TiGroup (*.tig) support (ram, archive & flash) in sending only
	- implemented Skip/Retry/Cancel dialog box when sending vars/apps
	- convert DUSB error packets into error message (O. Armand request)
	- convert DBUS error packets into error message (K. Kofler request)


Improvements:
-------------

	- added option allowing to select behaviour of backup (old: backup/group, new: TiGroup)
	- 'Ready' reopens SilverLink device like DirectLink (the only way to clear error)
	- reworked user boxes: use GTK standard ones to look better


Bug fixes:
----------

	- sending app without dirlist makes TiLP crash
	- re-enabled 'local/full path' option
	- possible conflict between FLASH token & FLASH folder
	- delete var: increase timeout due to garbage collecting
	- timeout in send_flash, send_tigroup and del_var
	- file can be selected several times (file selection)
	- path with save dialog
	- Unbuntu Bug #49256 (reported as bug #1513271)
	- 'Current Folder' button didn't set path properly
	- can't read some TI86 files due to bad padding of varname => there are _four_ TI-86 file format!


Known bugs:
-----------

	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support don't work on 2.6.x kernel series.
	- [win32] many cables (GrayLink & SilverLink may use up to 100% of CPU when running)


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
