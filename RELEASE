			[ Release notes ]



Old     version:  1.04 (14/05/2007)
Current version:  1.06 (??/07/2007)


SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- grouping/ungrouping capabilites have been removed from TiLP. They are
	now provided thanks to a new application called Group File Manager (GFM)
	thru the popup-menu. GFM is available here: <http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_gfm/>.
	

Improvements:
-------------

	- Window, RclWindow and TblSetup variables are now supported
	- sending/receiving of named list on TI84+/USB is now supported


Bug fixes:
----------

	- variable existence checking in action box
	- TiGroup files correctly handled with TI84+/USB
	- *nix compile fix: fixed KDE path detection for multilib systems with
	                    both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries installed


Known bugs:
-----------

	- the transfer dialog box is not always refreshed
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is
		  needed after module removal		
	- [win32] many cables (GrayLink & SilverLink may use up to 100% of CPU when running)


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
