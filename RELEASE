TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.

	- internationalization support: French locale is currently included
		If you want to add a locale, drop a mail at <tilp-devel@lists.sf.net>.

	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:

		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is

Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
