			[ Release notes ]



Previous version: 6.72	    (24/04/2004)
Current version:  6.74b		(02/07/2004)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- added NULL cable support

Improvements:
-------------

	- VTi and TiEmu cables were swapped
	- 6.74b: fixes a crash when parsing a folder with dots (such as a1.2).
	

Known problems:
---------------

	- [Win32]: the GTK-Wimp theme displays a lot of warning under non-NT Windows. 
		It has been currently disabled.
	- [Linux]: the timeout value can not be changed with kernel modules.
		Consequently, OS upgrades will fail...
		=> fixed by tipar v1.19, tiser v1.20, tiusb v1.07b or Linux kernel >= 2.4.27 or 2.6.7.


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
