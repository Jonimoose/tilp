SubVersion (SVN) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- tilp: improved UI, by Jon Sturm (Jonimus / TheStorm).
	- tilp: use more native, themable icons.
	- libticables: libusb 1.0 backend, for users of the many Linux distros which don't package libusb 1.0 proper anymore.
	- libticalcs: OS 2.x and 3.x support, variable deletion, folder creation, folder deletion, OS 1.x dumping.


Improvements:
-------------

	- libticables: cope with 84+(SE), 89T and Nspire (CAS) USB controller stacks, which want dummy reads or writes in some circumstances.
	  Most of the causes of variables of peculiar sizes failing to transfer have been fixed.
	- tilp: compatibility fixes for recent GTK+ versions.
	- all: commit MSVC 2008 build files.

Bug fixes:
----------

Between others (see the Changelog files for complete lists):
	- all: change encoding in .rc files.
	- all: lots of fixes for compiler warnings, memory leaks, crasher bugs
	- libticalcs: fix 86 ROM dumping.
	- libticalcs: cope with "-1" delays sent by the 84+ when writing to Flash memory, which used to hang (almost) forever.
	- libticalcs: Nspire ID retrieval.
	- tilp: fix display of files whose size is exactly 1 KB or 1 MB.
	- libticalcs, libtifiles: don't crash upon sub-folders of folders (Nspire OS 2.x and 3.x support them).
	- libtifiles, libticables, libticalcs: turn abrupt program aborts such as assert() and exit() into tests + ti*_critical().
	- libticalcs: fix a declaration after statement.
	- libticalcs: cope with martian packets sent by Nspire OS >= 1.7 when replying to a session close packet.


Known bugs:
-----------

	- [nspire] sometimes need to restart TiLP if connection fails
	- [nspire] on Windows, connection losses can happen, but unplugging and replugging the calculator seems to fix the problem
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is
		  needed after module removal
		=> both of these bugs are due to the Titanium USB internal firmware
