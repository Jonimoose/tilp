			[ Release notes ]



Previous version: 6.67-beta2 (11/05/2003)
Current version:  6.71	     (16/04/2004)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- none

Improvements:
-------------

	- [WIN32] fixed error 997 (overlapped I/O in progress) by 
	new SilverLink driver (v2.3)
	- [WIN32] GTK now uses a theme engine (Gtk-Wimp) which gives 
	Windows look & feel (it supports XP theming, too !)
	- communication box simplified
	- some internal clean-ups
	- TIB support
	- many bug fixes from BugTracker: 
		#904838: crash with /usr/lib/tilp
		#847930: tib files,
		#837114: bad TI85 file format
		#600195: idem 
		#600297: idem
		#801482: rom dump pbs w/ usb
		#781694: crash with flashsav.89z
		#775151: wrong DLL version
		#738486: TI83+ flash app timeout
		#689704: idem
	- and some others.
	

Known problems:
---------------

	- [Linux]: the timeout value can not be changed with kernel modules.
	Consequently, OS upgrades will fail...


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
