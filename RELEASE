Known bugs:
-----------

	- [nspire] sometimes need to restart TiLP if connection fails
	- [nspire] on Windows, connection losses can happen, but unplugging and replugging the calculator seems to fix the problem
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is
		  needed after module removal
		=> both of these bugs are due to the Titanium USB internal firmware
