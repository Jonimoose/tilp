TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.

Note: direct USB cable of TI84+ / TI89 Titanium is currenly unusable by TiLP 
	but supported by our driver. Preliminary support exists for development 
	purposes only.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- TiGroup (*.tig) file support


Improvements:
-------------

	- support Unicode (UTF-8) filenames


Bug fixes:
----------

	- cable bug fixes
	- cable probe: use first cable instead of the last one.


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
