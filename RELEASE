			[ Release notes ]



Current version:  0.17-beta	(23/06/2006)
Current version:  0.20-beta (05/08/2006)


SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- full TiGroup (*.tig) support (ram, archive & flash)


Improvements:
-------------

	- refresh right frame after var/app retrieval
	- don't allow use of USB options is USB support is not available.
	- for now, use this naming scheme for TI9x var filenames: folder.var.extension (like TiConnect)
	- allow to directly input the path from keyboard
	- added Seamonkey to the browser list, suggest Firefox instead of the obsolete Mozilla Suite (kevin)


Bug fixes:
----------

	- NULL dereference in file selector
	- bad displaying of lists on TI84+
	- can't send TI85 backup from command line
	- bug #1523480: --no-gui doesn't work


Known bugs:
-----------

	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support don't work on 2.6.x kernel series.
	- [win32] many cables (GrayLink & SilverLink may use up to 100% of CPU when running)


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
