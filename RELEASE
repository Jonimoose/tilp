New capabilities:
-----------------

	- grouping/ungrouping capabilites have been removed from TiLP. They are
	now provided thanks to a new application called Group File Manager (GFM).
	This application is still available thru the popup-menu...
	GFM is available here: <http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_gfm/>.
	

Improvements:
-------------

	- Window, RclWindow and TblSetup variables are now supported
	- sending/receiving of named list on TI84+/USB is now supported
	- [win32] removed PortTalk I/O driver due to license issues. Replaced by GPL'ed
		MPlayer's DhaHelper driver.
	- [win32] removed my USB driver due to license issues. Replaced by GPL'ed
		libusb-win32 driver. Those drivers are now automatically registered in
		the Plug&Play Windows database.


Bug fixes:
----------

	- variable existence checking in action box
	- TiGroup files correctly handled with TI84+/USB
	- *nix compile fix: fixed KDE path detection for multilib systems with
	                    both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries installed
	- close link cable before probing and open it after otherwise current
		link cable can't be probed (serial & parallel)


Known bugs:
-----------

	- the transfer dialog box is not always refreshed
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is
		  needed after module removal


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
