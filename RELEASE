TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.

	- none

Improvements:
-------------

Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows me to 
improve TiLP and make it better.
Feel free to mail me, I always reply to mails.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
