			[ Release notes ]



Current version:  0.13		(28/05/2006)
Current version:  0.17-beta	(23/06/2006)


SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- device box can display detected USB devices
	- sending & receiving of several FLASH apps at once
	- sending of apps/vars at once


Improvements:
-------------

	- USB device reconnection
	- updates dirlist & memory when sending apps (caching)
	- added accelarator keys in popup menu (left frame)
	- scan for '/dev/bus/usb', too
	- re-enabled TI84+ OS sending (tested: OK)
	- updated 68k ROM dumpers to dump 8 MB on HW4 and rebuilt them with the latest CVS TIGCC (GCC 4.1.1, reduces size) (kevin)
	- reworked the management of progress bar mechanism
	- checked/fixed all progress bars
	- Silver/DirectLink cable are now reopened instead of being	reset when error occurs.
		More efficient about error clearing.


Bug fixes:
----------

	- bug #1499672: sorting by type didn't work properly on the pc-panel
	- [win32] bug #1499672: sorting by name is case insensitive for now
	- manpage about DirectLink
	- acceleratorkeys in popup menu (right frame)
	- [linux] usb_set_config error/warnings in the kernel log (dmesg) due to misuse 
		of libusb and kernel API changes
	- buffer overflow in the D-BUS layer and possible bug in the DUSB packet layer
		which may trigger segfault/crash in screenshot
	- don't count archived (=FLASH) variables in the memory labels
	- bug in tifiles_file_is_tib which didn't detect TIB files.


Known bugs:
-----------

	- DirectLink support may be broken under Linux. I'm still working on this 
		burning/complex issue!
	- many cables (GrayLink & SilverLink may use up to 100% of CPU when running)


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
