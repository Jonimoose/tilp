TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (Cocoa) and FreeBSD (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.

-----------------

	- TI84+ with USB support (but OS sending disabled because not tested enough)
	- Titanium with USB support
	- auto-detect USB devices at startup (configurable)
	- added a new label which display RAM/FLASH free &used
	- added Titanium/USB ROM dumper


Improvements:
-------------

	- reworked displaying of Hand-Held Informations box
	- reworked full auto-detection
	- show more levels in the current path
	- update remote frame from the action box
	- update memory used when sending/deleting variables
	- raise the action box when sending files from command line in GUI mode (O. Armand)
	- removed certificate support (deprecated)
	- don't need to close/re-open TiLP when USB hand-held turned off

Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
