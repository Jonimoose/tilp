			[ Release notes ]



Old     version:  1.00 (20/09/2006)
Current version:  1.01 (10/11/2006)


SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- [linux] Titanium/USB hand-held support (for testing: see known bugs)
	- [linux] USB kernel module support re-added for Titanium/USB 
		(for testing: may work better than built-in libusb support)


Improvements:
-------------

	- added probing of TI84+ non-SE
	- [bsd] USB fixes
	- make source code more reliable (B. Moody)
	- disabled checksum file check which was accidentally enabled


Bug fixes:
----------

	- crash on device box opening
	- timeout when requesting device info from Titanium/USB
	- ROM dumper: only dumps 4MB  on HW4 as HW3 (K. Kofler)


Known bugs:
-----------

	- the transfer dialog box is not always refreshed
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		* w/ kernel module: you don't have the issue stated below but replugging is
		  needed after module removal		
	- [win32] many cables (GrayLink & SilverLink may use up to 100% of CPU when running)


Bug report:
-----------

If you think that you have found a bug, please report it. This allows us to 
improve TiLP and make it better.

It seems that some guys have backup problems with TI89/92+. If you have 
installed a kernel or some other assembly program which modify the FLASH or
RAM memory, this may explain your problem. But, mail us anyways.
