If you have a SilverLink cable or an hand-held with a USB/mini-USB
cable, you will need the LPG's USB driver.<br>

Otherwise, a anonymous contributor has written this document:<br>
<pre>Before reading the directions below, beware: TiLP will not work if your calculator<br>is already configured for, and running fine with TI Connect (and vice versa).<br>So if you're fine with TI Connect, read no further. Otherwise, here's the steps<br>I took (and got it working for me):<br><br>1) Go to <a
 href="http://www.ticalc.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ticalc.org</a> and do a search for "tiglusb" (without quotes).<br>2) When the search finishes, click on the choice that says "Windows Driver for<br>Silver/DirectLink cables, v3.6 (bin)".<br>3) Download "tiglusbinf3.zip" (by clicking on it and pressing the "Save" button<br>on the "File Downlad" pop-up) to the Desktop (you can choose somewhere else<br>if you like, just remember where you save it to because you'll need to get to<br>the location later...I'm just using the desktop to make things easier).<br><br>4) Extract the contents of "tiglusbinf3.zip" to a desired location (XP's built-in<br>extractor will extract it to C:\Documents and Settings\*&lt;User<br>Name&gt;\Desktop\tiglusbinf3 by default. To make things easier on us later, delete<br>"tiglusbinf3", then click ok). Repeat again for "driver_xp.zip" inside<br>the "tiglusbinf3" folder<br><br>5) Open the "driver" folder and copy "TiglUsb.inf", "TiglUsb.sys" and "TiglUsb.dll"<br>into the location where TiLP was installed (Default location is C:\Program<br>Files\TiLP). Now when you run TiLP, you should get an error saying your calculator<br>is not turned on (but still won't work).<br><br>If you've gotten this far, now we need to install the DirectLink driver made<br>especially for TiLP.<br><br>1) Connect your calculator and turn it on.<br>2) Right-click "My Computer" and choose "Properties" out of the drop-down menu.<br>3) Click on the "Hardware" tab, then click the "Device Manager" button.<br>4) At the bottom should be "Universal Serial Bus controllers". Expand the list<br>(by clicking on the plus sign next to it).<br><br>5) In the list should be "TI Educational Handheld Device". Right-click it, and<br>choose "Update Driver..." from the drop-down menu.<br><br>6) At this time, the Hardware Update Wizard should pop up. It may ask you if<br>you want to connect to Windows Update to search for the driver. If not, go to<br>the next step, otherwise, click the button by "No, not at this time" and then<br>click next.<br><br>7) Click the button next to "Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)",<br>then click next.<br>8) Make sure the check box next to "Include this location in the search:" is<br>selected, then click the "Browse" button.<br><br>9) Browse to the driver folder where you copied "TiglUsb.inf" and such from<br>(if you've followed the example, this location should be C:\Documents and<br>Settings\*&lt;User Name&gt;\Desktop\tiglusbinf3\driver). Click "OK" on the "Browse<br>For Folder" window, then "Next" on the Hardware Update Wizard window.<br><br>10)Now Windows should install the driver. In the middle you may get a warning<br>about the driver not being digitally signed. Just click "Continue Anyway".<br><br>11)Click finish on the Hardware Update Wizard. If everything's gone according<br>to plan, TiLP should work properly now! :) Also, when you go back to "Device<br>Driver", it will say "TI-GRAPH/DIRECT LINK USB" in place of "TI Educational<br>Handheld Device" (so long as your calculator is on and connected ;) ).<br><br>Hope this helps. If not, feel free to email me at <a
 href="http://granny.maison/squirrelmail/src/compose.php?send_to=xaelith%40msn.com">xaelith@msn.com</a><br><br>*= whatever username you use when you log on to your computer. For example,<br>mine was "HP_Administrator" until i changed it. So C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;User<br>Name&gt; would be changed to C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Administrator.</pre>
