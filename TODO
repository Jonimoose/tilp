This is a list of some things to do:

10) critical bug: sending LCHASE.8xp from 20sec.zip package failed on TI84+ USB due to un-detokenization
	of varname (because tifiles2 don't know whether file is targetted for TI84+ or TI84+ USB).
	Sending is OK, receiving is still KO because we should pass vartype with named lists.

20) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
   allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)

21) SilverLink drivers don't install on Vista2

23) TiLP used as a normal user

24) user boxes should be showed at center

Tips:
	Set svn:eol property to native on all files

	Run './configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no' for use with
		ValGrind. Run 'valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./test'
