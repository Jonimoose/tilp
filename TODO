This is a list of some things to do:

1) updates dirlist & mem when sending apps
2) implement full/true backup (ram = flash) into a TIG file
3) bug #1493368
4) user box: overwrite/skip all
5) bug #1499672
6) sorting is called twice in clist

20) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
   allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)
21) SilverLink drivers don't install on Vista2

- bug #1499672:
<<
 My pc:
AMD Athlon64 3200+
Windows XP Professional SP2
TiLP-II 0.13

My calc:
TI-84 Plus Silver Edition
TI-OS 2.30

Transfer bugs (both BlackLink and DirectLink):

* When I try to send a group (*.8xg) to my calc all
files are received unpacked on the calc, even when
'Recv. as group' is enabled

* When I try to send a group from calc to pc, it seems
to be transferred, but not a single file appears on my pc

* Every edit-locked BASIC and AMS program is marked ASM
and received as *.8xz, of course this has to be *.8xp
for both locked BASIC and ASM

* Only when the *.8xz file wasn't in the archive on the
calc, I could succesfully rename 8xz to 8xp, but when
that same file was archived, an invalid file came out
after the same change

Interface bugs:

* Files on calc cannot be sorted by attr/name/etc.

+ Sorting by type doesn't work properly on the pc-panel

+ Sorting by name is Linux's way: difference between
upper- and lowercase. I know this is not a real bug,
but it's a bit confusing to native Windows users

Other bugs:

+ The file TiglUsb.sys is not included in the
installer, this is very confusing to noobs ;-)


I hope my descriptions are extensive enough to fix the
bugs.

Good luck!

- suggestions from O. Armand:
<<
Et un truc qui n'est peut-être pas spécifique au DirectLink (je ne
sais pas trop, je n'utilise pas TiLP d'habitude) : c'est dommage que
"Invalid packet. Cause: a transmission error" soit affiché au lieu de
messages d'erreur plus expicites, par exemple quand on essaie
d'écraser une variable archivée ou quand il n'y a plus assez de
mémoire.

Pendant qu'on est dans TiLP, un autre truc qui serait pratique, ce
serait de pouvoir taper directement le chemin d'accès du dossier
courant (comme on peut par exemple le faire dans l'explorateur
Windows), plutôt que de devoir passer par l'UI.

- suggestions of 	"Travis Evans" <travisgevans@earthlink.net>:
<<
* Selecting multiple files is a little strange. Ctrl and Shift keys while 
clicking in the lists work as expected, but unlike with other programs 
like Konqueror, I cannot use both Ctrl and Shift at the same time. TiLP 
acts like I only pressed Ctrl. It would be nice if Ctrl+Shift worked as 
in many programs.

Also, when I have multiple files selected and try to drag them, it 
erases my selection. If I hold Ctrl while dragging, it doesn't erase the 
selection, but it toggles the state of the file where I started 
dragging. This is somewhat confusing. (In other words, dragging should 
not also count as clicking.)
