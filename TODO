To do:
------

1) critical bug: sending LCHASE.8xp from 20sec.zip package failed on 
	TI84+ USB due to un-detokenization of varname (because tifiles2 don't 
	know whether file is targetted for TI84+ or TI84+ USB).
	Sending is OK, receiving is still KO because we should pass vartype 
	with named lists.

2) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add 
	a function in ticables2 which allow to use 2 methods (active polling 
	w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS).

3) need to exit TiLP to clear a USB error

4) progress bars are not always updated (T. Evans)

6) support i18n (n'a jamais marché, à comprendre)

7) fix Titanium/USB sous Linux

8) bug #1657175: a compiled ASM file can not be send thru D-USB

9) bug:
	<<
	Romain, you did a great job finalizing the version, but a bug still
	subsists: with a TI 92+ HW2 with 2.09 AMS, linked to a Windows 2000
	computer through a Black Link Compatible cable, a click on "Screenshot"
	makes a crash (and no screenshot..)
	>>

10) bug: broken pipe problem (T. Evans); see long mail about that

11) bug: impossible to flash TI 83+SE either with TiLP-I or II (see long mail)

Tips:
	Set svn:eol property to native on all files

	Run './configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no' for use with
		ValGrind. Run 'valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./test'
