This is a list of some things to do:

11) user box: skip/retry/cancel

13) critical bug: sending LCHASE.8xp from 20sec.zip package failed on TI84+ USB due to un-detokenization
	of varname (because tifiles2 don't know whether file is targetted for TI84+ or TI84+ USB).
	Sending is OK, receiving is still KO because we should pass vartype with named lists.

20) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
   allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)
21) SilverLink drivers don't install on Vista2

32) some apps can't be deleted. Why? Maybe I should forbid erasing apps...

33) check return value of all tifiles_xxxx calls into TiLP

//------

+ = done.
* = in progress.
- = to do...
