This is a list of some things to do:

0)
- remove /proc/bus/usb from ticables2 => deprecated !

1)
- select files for deletion, cancel/ok => violation in tree_selection_changed

2)
- SilverLink is still NACK'ed after error. Does not appear with TiLP1 => found => open/close instead of reset. Why ?
- SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)


- suggestions of 	"Travis Evans" <travisgevans@earthlink.net>:
<<
* Selecting multiple files is a little strange. Ctrl and Shift keys while 
clicking in the lists work as expected, but unlike with other programs 
like Konqueror, I cannot use both Ctrl and Shift at the same time. TiLP 
acts like I only pressed Ctrl. It would be nice if Ctrl+Shift worked as 
in many programs.

Also, when I have multiple files selected and try to drag them, it 
erases my selection. If I hold Ctrl while dragging, it doesn't erase the 
selection, but it toggles the state of the file where I started 
dragging. This is somewhat confusing. (In other words, dragging should 
not also count as clicking.)
