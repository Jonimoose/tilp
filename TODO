This is a list of some things to do:

11) user box: overwrite/skip all

13) critical bug: sending LCHASE.8xp from 20sec.zip package failed on TI84+ USB due to un-detokenization
	of varname (because tifiles2 don't know whether file is targetted for TI84+ or TI84+ USB).
	Sending is OK, receiving is still KO because we should pass vartype with named lists.

20) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
   allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)
21) SilverLink drivers don't install on Vista2

32) some apps can't be deleted. Why? Maybe I should forbid erasing apps...

- suggestion from K. Kofler:
<<
[16:31:40] *** Kevin Kofler is Online
[16:17:10] <Kevin Kofler> As-tu déjà regardé l'histoire des vars archivées (pas d'erreur convenable quand on essaie de les écraser, juste un timeout)?
[16:20:28] <Kevin Kofler> Ce bogue rend aussi le link inutilisable jusqu'à ce qu'on éteint/rallume la calculatrice, d'ailleurs (il doit y avoir un error flag ou qqch. comme ça qui est mis: la calculatrice répond à certaines requêtes et pas d'autres).
[16:21:09] <Kevin Kofler> Ce qui sert en tout cas, c'est débrancher, éteindre, rebrancher (ce qui rallume la calculatrice).

- suggestions of 	"Travis Evans" <travisgevans@earthlink.net>:
<<
* When transmission errors occur, it would be nice to have Retry and 
Skip buttons for backups or sending/receiving multiple files. When TI 
Connect encounters an error, it gives a Retry button that tries the 
operation again starting with the variable where the error occurred, and 
a Skip button that continues the operation but skips the file where the 
error occurred.

*I'm using:
SUSE Linux 9.3 (kernel 2.6.11)
TiLP 6.81 (cables=3.9.7, files=0.6.6, calcs=4.6.2)
Silverlink USB cable

I've been using TiLP for a long time to transfer data to and from my 
TI-89 with few problems. But today for the first time, I need to 
transfer some files to my old TI-86, but I'm not getting anywhere.  
Lots of strange things are happening.  I did remember to go to the 
communication settings and select TI-86 first.

Another issue I'm having which appears unrelated to the above is that I 
can only send one file at a time.  If I try to send more than one file, 
only the first gets sent, then a "connection timed out (errno = 110)" 
error appears every time.  This makes group files impossible to send, 
since only one file gets sent.  This problem doesn't happen when I 
transfer files with the TI-89.
