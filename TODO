To do:
------

1) progress bars are not always updated (T. Evans)

2) bug: broken pipe problem (T. Evans); see long mail about that

3) need to exit TiLP to clear a USB error

4) fix Titanium/USB sous Linux

6) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add 
	a function in ticables2 which allow to use 2 methods (active polling 
	w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS).

+ = done.
* = in progress.
- = to do...

Tips:
	Set svn:eol property to native on all files

	Run './configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no' for use with
		ValGrind. Run 'valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./test'
