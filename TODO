This is a list of some things to do:

* image loader: PCX/XPM/JPG

- use Vti skins and display a TI keyboard for remote control

+ implement the management of group files (merging, splitting, exploding, ...)
+ a better doc (html) & Help formatted (html, groff, gnome help ??)
+ TI83(+) ROM dumper (for Tilem)
+ view into PAK/Group (clist+menus+send var) -> plugin (Group File Manager)
+ if parport not compiled in kernel, tilp segfaults
+ command line: the ability to use any function from cmdline (OS, ROMdump, ...)
+ add an overwrite protection (PC->TI) by systematically doing a dirlist
+ force ready call (auto-detect) before each function
+ extract a ROM image from a .tib/.9xu/.89u FLASH file
+ TI89/92+ ROM dump
+ TI89/92+ pbs and auto-detection
+ TI89 support to improve (especially HW2)
+ accelerator keys for the dialog box buttons. Mouse is sometimes boring.
+ fargo4TiLP & fargo (flinker): done through TiFFEP
+ close TiLP after command line use (console/Explorer)
+ do associations types in IS instead of Tilp.reg
+ sending by command line: use the file type for determining the calc type
+ TI86 has a backup capability but no TIGL file format !!!
+ TI82, 85 support to finish
+ fonts in dboxes !
+ TI83 support to update
+ locale & i18n
+ the ability to override the file format to send (82 file -> TI85)
+ internationalization of TiLP
+ if 2 sessions of TiLP are launched under Win32, it may cause some pbs
+ startup box
+ rights access pbs on directories
+ pixmaps
+ choose the font to use in the right window

+ = done.
* = in progress.
- = to do...
