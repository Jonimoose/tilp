This is a list of some things to do:

11) user box: overwrite/skip all

13) critical bug: sending LCHASE.8xp from 20sec.zip package failed on TI84+ USB due to un-detokenization
	of varname (because tifiles2 don't know whether file is targetted for TI84+ or TI84+ USB).
	In fact, we shouldn't extract hand-held from file but pass target hand-held instead.
	May need some work or worse (API changes).

20) SilverLink cable is using more CPU than it should do under Windows => add a function in ticables2 which
   allow to use 2 methods (active polling w/ timeout, needed by TiEmu and timeout managed by OS)
21) SilverLink drivers don't install on Vista2

[16:31:40] *** Kevin Kofler is Online
[16:17:10] <Kevin Kofler> As-tu déjà regardé l'histoire des vars archivées (pas d'erreur convenable quand on essaie de les écraser, juste un timeout)?
[16:20:28] <Kevin Kofler> Ce bogue rend aussi le link inutilisable jusqu'à ce qu'on éteint/rallume la calculatrice, d'ailleurs (il doit y avoir un error flag ou qqch. comme ça qui est mis: la calculatrice répond à certaines requêtes et pas d'autres).
[16:21:09] <Kevin Kofler> Ce qui sert en tout cas, c'est débrancher, éteindre, rebrancher (ce qui rallume la calculatrice).

Et un truc qui n'est peut-être pas spécifique au DirectLink (je ne
sais pas trop, je n'utilise pas TiLP d'habitude) : c'est dommage que
"Invalid packet. Cause: a transmission error" soit affiché au lieu de
messages d'erreur plus expicites, par exemple quand on essaie
d'écraser une variable archivée ou quand il n'y a plus assez de
mémoire.

* When transmission errors occur, it would be nice to have Retry and 
Skip buttons for backups or sending/receiving multiple files. When TI 
Connect encounters an error, it gives a Retry button that tries the 
operation again starting with the variable where the error occurred, and 
a Skip button that continues the operation but skips the file where the 
error occurred.

*I'm using:
SUSE Linux 9.3 (kernel 2.6.11)
TiLP 6.81 (cables=3.9.7, files=0.6.6, calcs=4.6.2)
Silverlink USB cable

I've been using TiLP for a long time to transfer data to and from my 
TI-89 with few problems. But today for the first time, I need to 
transfer some files to my old TI-86, but I'm not getting anywhere.  
Lots of strange things are happening.  I did remember to go to the 
communication settings and select TI-86 first.

First I tried to send a 86G file, but TiLP caused a segmentation fault 
when trying to send it.  I tried to ungroup it in TiLP first, and it 
still segfaulted.  Then I ran the old TI-GRAPH LINK 86 software in 
WINE, and that program appeared to be able to ungroup the file without 
any trouble, and I could view the contents of the ungrouped files in 
it.  However, when I sent the ungrouped files using TiLP, the resulting 
files on the TI-86 had wrong sizes (way too large), and attempting to 
access them in any way (or deleting them) caused the calc to crash.

Several other files I have (whether grouped or not) cause the same 
issue.  I think that maybe files I created using FastLink (which was 
what I used for transferring back when I used Windows) might be the 
ones with this issue, but I don't have any way to confirm that for 
sure.  It seems maybe the header of the files is wrong, but that 
doesn't explain why TI-GRAPH LINK doesn't seem to have any problems 
with them.  TiLP doesn't appear to have any problems with files it 
creates itself (using TiLP to transfer a program to the computer then 
sending it back, for example).  But I have these old files that I 
really need sent to the calculator, and it isn't working.  Any ideas 
what's going on or if it can be fixed?

Another issue I'm having which appears unrelated to the above is that I 
can only send one file at a time.  If I try to send more than one file, 
only the first gets sent, then a "connection timed out (errno = 110)" 
error appears every time.  This makes group files impossible to send, 
since only one file gets sent.  This problem doesn't happen when I 
transfer files with the TI-89.

I'm not sure if these are bugs or what, and if so, if they're TiLP's 
fault or something else, so I'm writing to this mailing list first for 
any ideas.  I could send copies of the problem files if that would 
help.  Thanks.
