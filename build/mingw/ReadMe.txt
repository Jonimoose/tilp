Procedure to set up the environment:

- get MinGW & MSys from <http://www.mingw.org/> and install it
- get pkg-config (which depends on glib-dev) from <http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html>
- get the pango, atk, glib, gtk+ devel & runtime packages from <http://www.gimp.org>.
	Simply select and copies folders directly into MinGW.
- get the libxml2 from <http://gnuwin32.Sf.net>
- get the libglade from <http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownload&cid=3>

You may need to copy libti* installed files from MSys to MinGW (*.h, *.lib, *.pc).

Enjoy (especially Kevin who likes MiNGW ;-) !
