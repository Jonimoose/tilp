Win32

Below, you will find a methodology which is common to:
- libtifiles, libticables, libticalcs,
- tilp,
- tiemu.

You should strictly follow it else you will encounter some (very) weird stuffs !
Create this methodology takes me a lot of time and experimentations.

Well, let get's us:


- get MinGW & MSys from http://www.mingw.org and install them. You can merge 
them if you want but MinGW does not encourage this. This was my way until I discover
Tor' method (GiMP for Win32) with /target.
I assume you installed MinGW as C:\MinGW and MSys as C:\MSys

- create a MSys\target folder. To install the packages, simply uncompress 
	downloaded archives which contains 'lib', 'bin', ... folders
	and copy them into the /target folder (overwrite = yes).

- edit your MSys\etc\profile and add the following lines:
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/target/lib/pkgconfig"
	export CPPFLAGS="-I/target/include"
	export LDFLAGS="-L/target/lib"
	export PATH="/target/bin:$PATH"

- pkg-config: get it from <http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html> as
	well as glib (binary), libiconv (binary) and gettext-runtime (binary).
	Copy folders (bin, lib, ...) into MSys/target.

	Check install is good by a 'pkg-config.exe --help'.

- gtk+ 2.4: get glib-dev, gtk+-dev, atk-dev, pango-dev from the same location. You
	can get binaries if you want (not mandatory but should be better).

- libxml2 (pre-built): get it from <http://gnuwin32.Sf.net> and
	think to add the libxml2.pc provided and to remove libxml2.la.

- libglade (pre-built): get it from <http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/> as 
	devel package.

- libxml2 (rebuild): get libxml2-2.5.10 from <http://xmlsoft.org/sources/old/>.
	./configure --prefix=/target --without-ftp --without-http
	You will need zlib from <http://gnuwin32.Sf.net> as dependancy.

- libglade (rebuild): get libglade from ??
	./configure --prefix=/target

- ticables, tifiles, ticalcs:
	./configure --prefix=/target --disable-nls

- tilp:
	./configure --prefix=/target --disable-nls	


- get the libglade from http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownload&cid=3
