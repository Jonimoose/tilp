1°) This release is a native port of TiLP so you don't need any extra libraries.
There is now a single and small installable package (setup.exe).

2°) If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
the Win32 driver on the Linux Programmer Group at http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb.

Simply plug your link cable: Windows should detect a new device. Next, follow the
installation instructions.

You can install driver at any time (that is to say before or after TiLP installation).

Given that the LPG SilverLink driver has a Release date more recent than the Texas
Instruments OEM driver, this driver will be used prior to the TI one.

3°) This setup will install the PortTalk driver for Windows NT4/2000/XP machines.
This step may require an administrator account (at least for NT4).
You will need to REBOOT your machine after installation (if you plan to 
use a parallel or serial link cable).

4°) Unfortunately, TiLP does not have some nice TI fonts. By default, TiLP use the
Courier New font. Nethertheless, if you have installed the TI-Connect software, 
TiLP will use the TI's fonts.
