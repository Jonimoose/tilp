If you get an error message such as 'libglib-2.0.0.dll not found' when you attempt to 
run TiLP then you did not read some instructions at the installation stage ;-)

As explained in the Readme_Win32.txt file, you need to get some DLLs provided into
an installable package:

The GTK+ 2.x libraries are located at:
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tilp/gtk-win32-runtime.exe?download

roms.
